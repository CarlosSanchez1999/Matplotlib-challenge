# Matplotlib Challenge

## Description
This project explores the use of **Matplotlib** to analyze the effectiveness of various treatment regimens, focusing on the **Capomulin** regimen for reducing tumor volumes in mice. The project involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of tumor volume trends using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy**. It aims to uncover correlations between mouse weight and tumor volume, identify outliers, and evaluate the treatment's impact. A key challenge was ensuring data integrity by identifying and removing duplicates.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in your preferred IDE.
2. Execute the cells to clean the data, identify duplicates, and visualize tumor volume trends.
3. The notebook includes analyses such as:
   - Scatter plots of **mouse weight vs. average tumor volume**.
   - Line plots of **tumor volume vs. time** for specific mice.
   - Box plots showing the distribution of tumor volume across different regimens.
   - Calculation of correlation and regression models.
4. Use the project to understand tumor reduction trends associated with Capomulin and other regimens.
