# Matplotlib Challenge

## Description
This project explores the use of **Matplotlib** to analyze the effectiveness of various treatment regimens, focusing on the **Capomulin** regimen for reducing tumor volumes in mice. The project involves data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization of tumor volume trends using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy**. It aims to uncover correlations between mouse weight and tumor volume, identify outliers, and evaluate the treatment's impact. A key challenge was ensuring...

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Matplotlib-Challenge.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
   cd Matplotlib-Challenge
3.Install the required dependencies:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to explore the analysis.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in your preferred IDE.
2. Execute the cells to clean the data, identify duplicates, and visualize tumor volume trends.
3. The notebook includes analyses such as:
   - Scatter plots of **mouse weight vs. average tumor volume**.
   - Line plots of **tumor volume vs. time** for specific mice.
   - Box plots showing the distribution of tumor volume across different regimens.
   - Calculation of correlation and regression models.
4. Example scatter plot:
